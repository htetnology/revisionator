# revisionator
A simple quiz program that enables students to do their own revision of programming basics. As per coursework requirements, only the Question class was to be developed from scratch. Additionally, code improvements and error handling were expected for the remaining classes. RevisionatorUserInterface is the main class used to run the program. Developed using Java and Eclipse IDE.
